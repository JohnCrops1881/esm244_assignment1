## Data Summary

The Sierra Lakes Inventory Project (SLIP) was a research endeavor that ran from 1995-2002 and has supported research and management of Sierra Nevada aquatic ecosystems and their terrestrial interfaces. We described the physical characteristics of and surveyed aquatic communities for \>8,000 lentic water bodies in the southern Sierra Nevada, including lakes, ponds, marshes, and meadows.

```{r setup}

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(tsibble)

library(lubridate)
library(fable)
library(patchwork)

#install.packages('patchwork')

```

### Task 1: Code for Graph 1

```{r datawrangle}

amphibians_raw <- read.csv(here("data", "sierra_amphibians.csv"))
```

```{r filtergraph1}

amphibians_filtered <- amphibians_raw %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(survey_date)) %>% 
  filter(amphibian_species == 'RAMU') %>% 
  mutate(recorded_year = year(date)) %>% 
  filter(amphibian_life_stage == 'Tadpole' | amphibian_life_stage == 'Adult' | amphibian_life_stage == 'SubAdult') %>% 
  group_by(recorded_year, amphibian_life_stage) %>% 
  count()
```

```{r graph1}

frog_graph1 <- ggplot(data = amphibians_filtered, mapping = aes(x = recorded_year, y = n, group = amphibian_life_stage)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = amphibian_life_stage)) +
  labs(title = 'Total Yellow-Legged Frog (Rana Muscosa) Count By Year', x = 'Year', y = 'Amphibian Count') +
  theme_light()
  
```

### Task 1: Code for Graph 2

```{r filterdata2}

sierra_top_5 <- amphibians_raw %>% 
  filter(amphibian_species == 'RAMU') %>% 
  filter(amphibian_life_stage == 'Adult' | amphibian_life_stage == 'SubAdult') %>% 
  group_by(lake_id) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(lake_string = paste('Lake', lake_id)) %>% #I won't pretend that the following code for this chunk was my idea. This was devised by a friend of mine who works at Fish and Wildlife on a Discord call. They are way better at R than me. This turns the lake_id column into a string that can be more easily called by other functions.
  slice_max(n, n = 5) %>% #selecting the lakes in the top 5
  mutate(lake_string = fct_reorder(lake_string, n, .fun = 'max'))

```

```{r graph2}

frog_graph2 <- ggplot(data = sierra_top_5, aes(x = lake_string, y = n)) +
  geom_col(
    colour = 'cornflowerblue'
  ) +
  labs(
    title = 'Top Five Lakes for Adult and SubAdult Rana Muscosa',
    x = 'Amphibian Count',
    y = 'Lake',
    cex.main = .25
  ) +
  theme_light()

```

### Patchwork Figure

```{r}

combined_plot <- frog_graph1 + frog_graph2 + plot_layout(nrow = 2)

combined_plot + plot_annotation(
  title = 'Findings from Graphs 1 + 2',
  subtitle = 'regarding rana muscosa'
)

```

### Summary of Findings

Graphs compiled using data from the Sierra Lakes Inventory Project. Graph 1 (top) graphs total frog count by life stage, excluding EggMass, across all bodies of water. Graph 2 combines counts of frogs in the Adult and Subadult life stage, and shows the top 5 lakes by greatest observed counts.

-   For figure 1, years 1996 to 1997 saw a spike in observed frogs across all life stages- Adult, SubAdult, and Tadpole. Then, observations saw a decline until 2001, before spiking again in 2002.

-   For figure 2, the lake that featured the highest count of frogs was Lake 50183.
